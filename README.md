### Install Hugo

()[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/]

> Since Hugo 0.48, Hugo uses the Go Modules support built into Go 1.11 to build. The easiest way to get started is to clone Hugo in a directory outside of the GOPATH, as in the following example:

```
mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git
cd hugo
go install --tags extended
```
